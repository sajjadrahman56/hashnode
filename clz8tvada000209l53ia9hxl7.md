We are living in an era of state-of-the-art LLMs (Large Language Models), where new models emerge almost everyday. Gemini is one such LLM developed by Google.

Before using the Gemini API, it's essential to have a clear understanding of LLMs, as this knowledge can help in various tasks like fine-tuning models.

### What is LLM?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a specialized machine learning model that can generate text from a prompt and perform language translation. It predicts the next word based on probabilities derived from a massive sequence of words. The transformer architecture is at the core of most LLMs.

In 2017, Google's research team introduced the transformer model in a research paper titled "Attention is All You Need." Due to its efficiency, scalability, and superior performance, the transformer model stands out from traditional machine or deep learning models.

Many people mistakenly think that `LLMs` are only used for chat applications. However, they have numerous applications, such as being used in virtual home devices like Amazon Alexa.

### Can I run LLM on device ?

Running an LLM model on-premises is not easy due to computational costs and potential overload errors. For these reasons, many LLMs are accessible either through a web interface or an API. The user's request, in text form, is sent to the pre-trained model via the API.

Gemini, or Gemma models, are a series of state-of-the-art language models developed by AI researchers at Google. The Gemini series includes Ultra, Pro, Flash, and Nano models, each designed for specific tasks. All of these models are accessible through the Google Gemini API.
