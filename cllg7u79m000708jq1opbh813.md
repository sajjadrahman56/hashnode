In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within either single ('') or double ("") quotation marks. It's a fundamental data type used to represent textual data. Strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and even spaces. //

### How strings work in Python

### Creating Strings

we can create a string by using '' or double quotation marks. for example

```python
myString = "Mlops journey 2023"
country = 'Bangladesh'
name ='sajjad rahman'
```

### Indexing

An index refers to the position of a character within that string. It's a numerical value that helps identify the location of a specific character. Also, we know that index starts from 0 and increases by 1 . *For example*

```python
myString = "Mlops journey 2023"
myString[0] 
'M' # output 
myString[7]
'j'
```

**Indexing:** Each character in a string has a specific index, starting from 0 for the first character. You can access individual characters using their indices. For example, `"Python"[0]` returns `'P'`.

**Negative Index:** Yes, the negative index is allowed in Python. where `-1` corresponds to the last character, `-2` to the second-to-last, and so on. *For example*

```python
myString = "Mlops journey 2023"
myString[-1]
'3' # output
myString[-8]
'n' # output
```

### **String Slicing**

Slicing allows you to extract a portion of a string. we can specify a start index, an end index (exclusive), and a step size. *For example,*

```python
myString[3:]
'ps journey 2023'
myString[3:8]
'ps jo'
```

### **String Concatenation**

We can combine strings using the `+` operator. For example,

```python
firstName = 'sajjad'
lastName = 'rahman'
fullNmae = firstName + lastName
print(fullName)
'sajjad rahman' # output
```

### **String Length**

The `len()` function returns the number of characters in a string. For example,

```python
len(myString)
18 # output
```
